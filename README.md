# Exercise_Tracker
This Exercise Tracker app allows users to log their workouts and track calories burned. Using the Nutritionix API, users can input exercise details, and the app calculates calories and duration. The data is then saved to a Google Sheets document using the Sheety API for easy tracking and access.
